# What are the possible nodes and edges of our network?

## Retweets
If an user A retweets a tweet of an user B there is a directed link:

A -- retweets --> B (or the other side <-- is retweeted --)

The real connection is user--> tweet, because the user "agrees" with the tweet, 
but maybe he don't have a strong tie with the user B, for example is quite possible
he don't follow the "writer". 

Each users may write more than one tweet, so the number of retweets considered in the link
should consider that?

Technical: how to retrieve who retweeted a tweet?
