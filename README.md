This repository contains the code base for the [Social Network Analysis](https://elearning.di.unipi.it/course/view.php?id=114) course hosted by the Master's degree in Computer Science of the University of Pisa. For our project we built a network consisting of authors of tweets regarding the Cambridge Analytica - Facebook scandal, exploded on the 17th of March (2018) and with a  first initial outburst of about a week. 

The crawled network has been built by considering authors of tweets contaning the top trend hashtags about the case:
  * __#cambridgeanalytica__ 
  * __#facebookgate__
  * __#deletefacebook__ 
  * __#zuckerberg__
  
The links of the network consists in the following/follower relationship between the identified authors.
